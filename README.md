This project comes with the necessary files to start working immediately.

We recommend opening this very same repository using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command. 

This is the repository you need to fork and open:

```

**ðŸ‘‰ Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

Once your project and code have finished opening, you can go ahead and open the `./src/sql/queries.sql` file and start solving each exercise inside the notebook.

## ðŸš› How to deliver this project

Once you have finished solving the exercises, be sure to commit your changes, push them to your repository, and go to 4Geeks.com to upload the repository link.

## Solutions

We also incorporated the solution samples in `./src/solution.py` that we strongly suggest you only use if you are stuck for more than 30 minutes or if you have already finished and want to compare it with your approach.
